I'm a Developer, DevOps enthusiast, Father, and cynic. I have almost 20 years of experience in the industry.
My background was originally .Net Web Development, but evolved towards React and Next.JS via a raft of intermediate 
technologies. Due to working on short-term projects with no dedicated infrastructure 
resources, I was an early adopter of Azure and AWS, making all the mistakes along the way.

I've seen first-hand the migration from Physical Servers to VMs, Cloud PaaS and now Cloud Native, Containers, Kubernetes and Serverless.

My interest lies in any topic or tool that allows us to make better techincal decisions. 
These decisions can often be intricate and result in compromises between 
maintainability, cost and techical maturity. Over time I've become less enthuastic about 
proprietary solutions and more interested in open standards.

Having worked in small teams and companies, I'm also interested in any
topic around monitoring and optimising cloud costs.
