Whilst working for [OMM](https://omm.agency), we were commissioned to create a system for the [International Rugby Experience](https://www.internationalrugbyexperience.com/) 
, a new museum and interactive experience in Limerick, Ireland. The museum is designed to
showcase the history of rugby in Ireland and around the world. The museum is split into
several zones, each with a different theme. The museum is designed to be interactive, with
visitors able to take part in games, simulations and visualisations.

Visitors are given a QR code when they enter. As they move through the museum, they 'sign-in' 
to different exhibits to provide a personalised experience. The system needed to be able to track the visitors as they moved
through the museum, collect their scores across different activities and provide them with a scorecard at the end of the visit.


## Requirements

1. The system needed to be able to track visitors as they moved through the museum.
2. Visitor names can be entered at the time of ticket purchase or when tickets are collected. 
2. Individual Exhibits should be able to authorise a visitor and record scores and other data against a visitor record.
3. The system should be able to continue to work offline if the internet connection is lost.
4. Content and copy on each exhibit should be configurable by museum staff.
