![CloudFlare Pages](/static/images/cloudflare.webp)

This article will cover pipeline design for deploying a static site to CloudFlare Pages via GitHub Actions.
Similar to GitHub pages, Cloudflare offers a simple managed solution for deploying static sites. It's a very cheap
option, having a free tier suitable for personal sites. CloudFlare does have it's own build system but
we prefer integrating with GitHub Actions for visibility and standardisation purposes across projects.

## Source Control Branching Strategy

For the purposes of this article and in general we use the [Feature-Branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
This consists of a main branch and short-lived feature branches which are reviewed and merged using the Pull-Request mechanism.

## Workflows

This article uses [BPMN](https://www.bpmn.org/) as a diagram standard fo describing top-level workflow logic.
Firstly we will look at the workflow triggered when code is pushed, or a PR is merged into main.

### Main Branch Workflow
![Workflow Diagram](/static/images/cf_bpmn_main.svg)

This is a workflow without baseline Infrastructure as Code, because CloudFlare handle base infrastructure for us.

Applied to our scenario, the steps translate as follows: 

1. Validate Entry Criteria: We use a path filter to look for changes in the **src** folder.
2. Execute Build: We build and export as a static site. This step includes linting and type-checking.
3. Run integration tests: For demo purposes we have some (very) basic Jest integration tests.
4. Deploy to Staging Environment: We deploy the build to a staging environment using the official [GitHub Action](https://github.com/cloudflare/pages-action) for Cloudflare Pages.
Here we want to perform e2e tests in an environment as similar as possible to production without affecting the live site. We use the concept of branches within 
cloudflare to target a named staging environment. The step returns the url as an output.
5. Run E2E Tests: We use (very) simple PlayWright tests as Browser-based UI testing. This includes Firefox, Chrome and WebKit.
6. Deploy to Production: Repeat step 4 but targeting production. Specifying the main branch within Cloudflare ensures we
deploy to the production environment.

#### YAML
Here is an example [yaml](https://github.com/horizonmode/blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/cloudflare-main.yml) based on the main workflow for this blog.

```yml:cloudflare-main.yml

          directory: build
          gitHubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          branch: main
```

### PR Workflow
![Workflow Diagram](/static/images/cf_bpmn_pr.svg)

For a PR, we want a simplified workflow that won't affect production but providers testers or developers
a dedicated environment to review the PR.

Applied to our scenario, the steps translate as follows: 

  1. Validate Entry Criteria: We check if source control changes are included in the PR.
  2. If the PR includes source changes, we execute the build: Similar to the main pipeline we use node to build and export our Next-JS site. This includes linting and
type checking.
  3. Run Integration Tests: We run our Jest tests.
  4. We deploy to a Preview Environment with a URL specific to this PR. Provision Preview Environment: This functionality is again, built in to CloudFlare pages. When we execute
the [CloudFlare GitHub Action](https://github.com/cloudflare/pages-action) action will handle provisioning an environment based on the PR name. 

*note: I suggest having physically separate yml files for main and PR workflows to minimize the amount
of switching and filtering. In my experience this can lead to unreadable workflow files.

#### YAML
Here is an example [yaml](https://github.com/canary-ops/blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/cloudflare-pr.yml) based on the PR workflow for this blog.

```yml:swa-pr.yml
name: Build and Push to Cloudflare Pages (PR)

  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
    branches:
      - main

          filters: |
            src:
               - 'src/**'

  build_job:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action != 'closed' && needs.validate_entry.outputs.src == true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

          submodules: true
          lfs: false

          path: src/out

  run_integration_tests:
    needs: build_job
    secrets: inherit
    uses: ./.github/workflows/jest.yml

  deploy_to_preview:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action != 'closed'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: run_integration_tests
    name: Deploy to Preview
    steps:
      - name: Download build
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build
          path: build

      - name: Publish to Cloudflare Pages
        uses: cloudflare/pages-action@v1
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
          accountId: ${{ vars.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          projectName: ${{ vars.CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME }}
          directory: build
          gitHubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Extensions

This is a simple example. This could be extended to include:

- Cleanup Preview Environments after PRs are merged.
- Unit Tests.
- Smoke Tests after a Production Deployment.
- Manual Control for production deployment.
- Progressive Rollout or Canary Deployments (Potentially use Traffic Splitting feature for this in Static Web Apps).
- Expand PlayWright to test logic such as contact form submission.
- Implement a shorter workflow for simple content updates (Potentially filter steps based on changes to the data folder)
