summary: Analysis and Design of CI/CD Pipelines for the Main Branch in a Feature-Branch Workflow
---

One challenge with implementing Devops pipelines is descibing their underlying logic and assumptions. 
The yaml files themselves become complex and evolve quickly over time, making 
it difficult to look at an existing pipeline and quickly decipher. To address this
we can use a diagram standard such as BNMP to describe the high-level workflow. 
This is above and before implementation takes place. This design and planning activity
describes the objectives and logic of the workflow, and may not always map 1:1 to specific tasks
in the pipeline.

## Source Control Branching Strategy

We subscribe to the [Feature-Branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
This consists of a main branch and short-lived feature branches which are reviewed and merged using the Pull-Request mechanism.

### BPMN

This article uses [BPMN](https://www.bpmn.org) as a diagram standard. This is a standard for describing business
processes in general. The notation is outside the scope of this article, however hopefully it's intuitive enough 
to get started without learning this in detail.

### Main Branch Workflow

To give an example of BPMN in action, here is our abstract approach to all deployments regardless of tech-stack:

This is a simplified workflow to demonstrate they key stages involved in a typical CI/CD process. 
It's important to recognise that each step is it's own sub-workflow.

### Validate Entry Criteria

Ensure the branch and files included in the change meet the requirements of this pipeline. Entry 
criteria could also cover include check against commit standards.

### Execute Build

An abstract task to represent building an app. The implementation of this 
will be different for container-based workloads vs standalone. It will also
vary depending on tech stack.

### Run Integration Tests

Run integration tests against the build in the previous step. This can include
unit tests. No external urls are used in this step. The execution
will vary depending on which library used (Jest, Mocha, NUnit, MSTest etc).

### Provision Test Environment

Use Infrastructure as Code to provision a test environment. This step 
should also include validating Infrstructure as Code scripts.
Implementation will vary depending on the tool of choice (Terraform, Bicep etc).

### Deploy to Test Environment 

Deploy the build to a test environment. This should be 
logically separate to the production environment with it's own URL. 
We will use this test environment to run automated tests.

### Execute E2E Tests

We run E2E tests against the deployed site using the test URL. 
These tests should validate critical functionality work as expected, such as submitting a form, 
logging in and navigation.

### Provision Production Environment

Using the same Infrastructure as Code scripts as the test environment we provision the 
production environment. This may already exist, but as IaC scripts
should be idempotent we can run this script on every deploy. Environment variables
for production should be in GitHub or an external config manager to 
support this environment. 

### Deploy to Production

We deploy the same build artifact as we deployed to test. 
This step may also define a progressive rollout strategy such as Red/Green or Canary Deployments. 
We might also run smoke tests at this stage. 

In the next article we will look at the PR worflow.
