In the second part of this series, we will look at deploying Next-JS to 
Azure Static Web Apps using GitHub Actions and Bicep.

## Source Control Branching Strategy

For the purposes of this article and in general we use the [Feature-Branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
This consists of a main branch and short-lived feature branches which are reviewed and merged using the Pull-Request mechanism.

## Workflows

This article uses [BPMN](https://www.bpmn.org/) as a diagram standard fo describing top-level workflow logic.
Firstly we will look at the workflow triggered when code is pushed, or a PR is merged into main.

### Main Branch Workflow
![Workflow Diagram](/static/images/swa_bpmn_main.svg)

This is a simplified workflow to demonstrate they key stages involved in a typical CI/CD process. 

Applied to our scenario, the steps translate as follows: 

1. Validate Entry Criteria: We use a path filter to look for changes in the **src** or **infra** folders.
2. Provision Base Infrastructure: In our example this is a single Azure Static Web App, deployed with Bicep. This
deployment is idempotent.
23we export as a static site. This step includes linting and type-checking.
4. Run integration tests: For demo purposes we have some (very) basic Jest integration tests.
5. Provision Staging Environment: An Azure Static Web App comes with environments built-in, so this and step 8 are handled
by a combination of step 2 and the following deployment step which sets up an environment.
6. Deploy to Staging Environment: We deploy the build to a staging environment using the official [GitHub Action](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-deploy?tab=readme-ov-file) for static web apps.
This uses the [Oryx](https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx) build system which downloads a docker container to wrap CLI logic we would otherise implement manually. 
Here we want to perform e2e tests in an environment as similar as possible to production without affecting the live site.
7. Run E2E Tests: We use (very) simple PlayWright tests as Browser-based UI testing. This includes Firefox, Chrome and WebKit.
8. Provision Production Environment: See step 5.
9. Deploy to Production: Repeat step 6 but targeting the production environment.

#### YAML

### PR Workflow
![Workflow Diagram](/static/images/swa_bpmn_pr.svg)

For a PR, we want a simplified workflow that won't affect production but providers testers or developers
a dedicated environment to review the PR. We also want to validate and assess any changes to Bicep code. One 
limitation of using a static web app environments is that you can't easily review Bicep changes 
without affecting the production site. So we settle for a **what-if** deployment and validation 
as the basis for PR approval.

Applied to our scenario, the steps translate as follows: 

  1. Validate Entry Criteria: We check if infrastructure or source control changes are included in the PR.
  2. If the PR includes Bicep changes, we validate and run the **what-if** deployment. This gives us a report 
of changes that will be executed. We write this report to the PR in GitHub.
  3. If the PR includes source changes, we execute the build: Similarly to the main pipeline we use node to build and export our Next-JS site. This includes linting and
type checking.
  4. Run Integration Tests: We run our Jest tests.
  5. Provision Preview Environment: This functionality is again, built in to Static Web Apps. When we execute the following steps
the [Oryx](https://github.com/microsoft/Oryx) tool will handle provisioning an environment based on the PR name. 
  6. We deploy to a Preview Environment with a URL specific to this PR. Similar to steps 4 and 6 in the main pipeline we 
  leverage the official [GitHub Action](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-deploy?tab=readme-ov-file) for static web apps.

*note: I suggest having physically separate yml files for main and PR workflows to minimize the amount
of switching and filtering. In my experience this can lead to unreadable workflow files.

## Extensions

This is a simple example. This could be extended to include:

- Static Code Analysis steps.
- Unit Tests.
- Smoke Tests after a Production Deployment.
- Load Tests.
- Penetration Tests.
- Infrastructure Validation after a deployment.
- Manual Control for production deployment.
- Progressive Rollout or Canary Deployments (Potentially use Traffic Splitting feature for this in Static Web Apps).
- Expand PlayWright to test logic such as contact form submission.
- Implement a shorter workflow for simple content updates (Potentially filter steps based on changes to the data folder)
