summary: Analysis and Design of CI/CD Pipelines for Pull Requests in a Feature-Branch Workflow
---

In the previous article, we looked at designing a pipeline for the main branch in a Feature-Branch workflow. 
Now we will consider the logic for a pipeline for Pull-Request triggers.

## Source Control Branching Strategy

We subscribe to the [Feature-Branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
This consists of a main branch and short-lived feature branches which are reviewed and merged using the Pull-Request mechanism.

### BPMN

This article uses [BPMN](https://www.bpmn.org) as a diagram standard. This is a standard for describing business
processes in general. The notation is outside the scope of this article, however hopefully it's intuitive enough 
to get started without learning this in detail.

### PR Branch Workflow

To give an example of BPMN in action, here is our abstract approach to all deployments regardless of tech-stack:

Again, it's important to recognise that each step is it's own sub-workflow.

### Validate Entry Criteria

Ensure the branch and files included in the change meet the requirements of this pipeline. Entry 
criteria could also cover include check against commit standards such as having 
a linked work-item or ticket in the comments.

### Execute Build

An abstract task to represent building an app. The implementation of this 
will be different for container-based workloads vs standalone. It will also
vary depending on tech stack.

### Run Integration Tests

Run integration tests against the build in the previous step. This can include
unit tests. No external urls are used in this step. The execution
will vary depending on which library used (Jest, Mocha, NUnit, MSTest etc).

### Provision Preview Environment

Use Infrastructure as Code to provision a preview environment. This step 
should also include validating Infrstructure as Code scripts.
Implementation will vary depending on the tool of choice (Terraform, Bicep etc).

### Deploy to Preview Environment 

Deploy the build to a preview environment. This should have it's own URL. 
We will use this test environment for developers or testers to review the PR.
