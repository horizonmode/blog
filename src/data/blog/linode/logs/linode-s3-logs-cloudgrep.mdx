Following up the previous article on exporting logs from Kubernetes to Linode S3 
storage using FluentBit, now we focus on how to query those logs. This strategy
might fit situations where you have limited infrastructure resources, or 
very occassional querying requirements so running
a permanent centralised logging stack is not viable or necessary.

## Overview

The FluentBit exporter creates logs in the format **/log/kube/Y/m/d/H/M/S/UUID.gz**. These
get exported frequently depending on the configuration of the Tail and S3 FluentBit Plugins. 
Files are unique and never over-written or appended in S3. In our configuration we 
use GZIP compression. Whilst it is possible to download the entire container and use
grep locally, ideally we need a tool that can connect to S3 and query the container
like a filesystem.

## CloudGrep

[CloudGrep](https://github.com/cado-security/cloudgrep) is a utility written in Python
that allows you to query across files in S3 compatible Object Storage.

### Installation 

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Pip

#### Install pip and create virtual environment:

```bash
python3.12 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m venv ./  
source ./bin/activate  
```

#### Install packages:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Configuration
```bash
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=https://**region**.linodeobjects.com
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

#### Usage
```bash
python3 cloudgrep.py -b **bucket-name** -q **query**             
```
#### Example outputs

```bash
Bucket is in region: default : Search from the same region to avoid egress charges.
Searching 16494 files in **bucket** for **query**...
